# How to Run

## Simulation Visual Representation

The visual representation and simulation of changing networks using different protocols can be executed through the following Python files located in the `code/Simulations` directory:

- `ABR.py`: Simulates the network using the ABR protocol.
- `IABR.py`: Simulates the network using the IABR protocol.
- `DBIABR.py`: Simulates the network using the DBIABR protocol.

To run a simulation, navigate to the `code/Simulations` directory and execute the desired Python file:

```bash
python ABR.py
```

## Protocol Comparison

The main protocol comparison is performed using the `main.py` file located in the `/code/` directory. This file compares the protocols over the same network and produces results in various parameters, including network lifetime, average path hops, path length, and energy levels.

To run the protocol comparison, navigate to the `/code/` directory and execute the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will generate comprehensive results and metrics for each protocol, allowing for a detailed analysis and comparison.

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine and all required dependencies are satisfied before running the simulations. Additionally, feel free to explore and customize the simulation parameters within the respective Python files to suit your specific needs.
